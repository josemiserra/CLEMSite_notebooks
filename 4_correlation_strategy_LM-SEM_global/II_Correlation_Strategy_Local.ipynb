    "  In the experimental setup presented in the article, MatTek dishes were used to automatically correlate cells from light microscopy (LM) with electron microscopy (EM). Here we present the method used to achieve that. In the Part I we developed a global transformation used to drive the microscope to the specific cell. In this step we will try to increase the accuracy going to the local region. \n",
